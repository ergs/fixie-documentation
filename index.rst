Fixie: Cyclus-as-a-Service
============================
Fixie is a xonsh-powered Cyclus cloud. Fixie is thus a collection of services, each
in their own package, which are managed by the top-level ``fixie`` command and package.
Currently available services are:

* ``fixie-creds``: A credentialing service for managing and validating users.
* ``fixie-batch``: A batch execution and queuing service for running Cyclus jobs.
* ``fixie-data``: A service for manganing Cyclus databases and related files.


==================
Installation
==================
You can use ``conda`` or ``pip`` to install any or all of the fixie services, as well
as the top-level fixie package.  For example,


**conda**

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install -c conda-forge fixie fixie-batch

**pip**

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install fixie fixie-batch

.. note::

    For some services, such as ``fixie-batch``, Cyclus is required. While there
    is a Cyclus package available in conda-forge, there is not one on PyPI, and
    you would need to install Cyclus yourself.


===========
Quick Start
===========
Fixie is a command line application that starts up a Tornado web service. By default,
all services that are installed on a machine are started.  However, you can choose to
run just a subset of services that interest you. For example,

.. code-block:: bash

    $ fixie creds batch
    server:starting fixie http://localhost:8642
    ...

For more information, please see the `Usage page <usage.html>`_.  You can then ``POST``
JSON to various URLs that the services enable.  For instance, to register a new user,
you could:

.. code-block:: bash

    $  curl -X POST http://localhost:8642/register -d '{"user": "buttercup", "email": "tpb@example.com"}'
